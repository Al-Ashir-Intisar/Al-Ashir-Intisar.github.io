          <p>
            AI systems analyze vast amounts of medical data to assist in
            diagnosing diseases and suggesting treatment options. Notably,AI
            algorithms are used to interpret imaging data, potentially detecting
            abnormalities such as tumors or fractures faster and more accurately
            than human radiologists.

            AI helps in tailoring medical treatment to individual
            characteristics of each patient. By analyzing patterns in data
            collected from wearable devices, AI can make personalized healthcare
            recommendations and predict health risks.

            AI automates various routine processes in hospitals and clinics,
            including patient scheduling, data entry, and supply chain
            operations, thus freeing up more time for healthcare providers to
            focus on patient care.

            AI accelerates the process of drug discovery by predicting how
            different chemicals will interact and how likely they are to
            constitute a viable medication, significantly reducing the time and
            cost of bringing new drugs to market.

            Virtual assistants can provide 24/7 health monitoring and basic
            healthcare, such as offering medical information, scheduling
            doctor's appointments, or reminding patients to take their
            medication.

          Privacy and Data Protection in AI Healthcare
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            The use of AI in healthcare raises significant privacy concerns,
            especially regarding the handling of patient data. There is a
            critical need for stringent data protection measures to safeguard
            sensitive health information. Ensuring compliance with global
            privacy laws such as GDPR in Europe and HIPAA in the United States
            is essential for maintaining patient trust and securing health data
            against breaches.
