            Addressing disparities in healthcare access, especially in
            underserved and developing regions is a significant global
            challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a transformative
            role in bridging this gap by providing AI-powered diagnostic tools
            that offer critical healthcare support where traditional resources
            are limited.
