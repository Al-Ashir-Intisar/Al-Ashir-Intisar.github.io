          Main Focus: The integration of AI in primary care and general
          practitioners'(GP) perspectives on it. This study explores the
          perceptions and attitudes of GPs towards the integration of Artificial
          Intelligence into primary care. Through qualitative interviews, the
          researchers found that GPs are cautiously optimistic about the
          potential of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in
          administrative tasks. However, there is significant concern regarding
          the ethical implications, such as patient data privacy and the
          potential for AI to depersonalize the patient-care provider
          relationship. The study highlights a mixed reception among GPs, with
          many emphasizing the need for AI to complement rather than replace
          human judgment in healthcare.

        <p>
          This article examines the current and potential future applications of
          AI in psychological practice. The paper discusses various AI
          applications, including automated psychological assessment tools,
          therapeutic chatbots, and AI in clinical decision support systems.
          Luxton highlights critical ethical issues such as ensuring
          confidentiality, obtaining informed consent when AI tools are used,
          and the risk of AI making autonomous decisions without sufficient
          human oversight. The article calls for the development of ethical
          guidelines and training for psychologists to handle AI technologies
          responsibly, ensuring that these innovations benefit patient care
          without compromising professional standards.
