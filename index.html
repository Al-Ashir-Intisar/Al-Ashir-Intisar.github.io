        <h2>Welcome to Our Website!</h2>
        <p>
          We have seen exponential growth in the use of AI in our everyday
          lives. But there is one aspect of life that has seen a delayed
          integration of AI tools due to ethical and privacy concerns which is
          Healthcare. The use of AI tools in health care such as Medical
          Imaging, Predictive Analytics, Personalized Medicine, Spatial
          Proteomics, etc. is still in its infancy. This is because healthcare
          data is very private and poses risks and threats if not protected
          well. The use of AI tools in healthcare also raises ethical
          considerations like how much decision-making can be allowed by AI and
          under which circumstances and if a wrong decision is made through the
          use of AI who is to be blamed. This is why this topic is relatively
          new and requires more research and exploration and simultaneous mass
          education. We are using our interactive website to showcase some of
          the privacy concerns of handling certain types of data, like the
          privacy levels that come in when dealing with certain types of
          information. Throughout this project, we will be able to educate
          people on having a better understanding when it comes to their
          privacy, and ethical issues when it comes to AI in health-related
          fields.
