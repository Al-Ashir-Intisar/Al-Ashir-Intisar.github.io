        <h1>What is AI</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The concept of AI is based on the idea of building machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.</p>
        <p>AI systems are designed to analyze large amounts of data, learn from patterns and trends, and make predictions or recommendations based on this analysis. These systems can be trained to perform specific tasks with increasing accuracy over time, making them valuable tools in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more.</p>
        <p>Key components of AI include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Algorithms that enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn representations of data.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.</li>
            <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> The field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries and improve efficiency, productivity, and decision-making processes. However, it also raises ethical and societal concerns, including issues related to privacy, bias, and job displacement.</p>
